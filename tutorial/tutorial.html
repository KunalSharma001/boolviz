    <h5 class="subhead">1. AND Gate :</h5>
    <div class="content-gate">
        <p class="para1">An AND gate is a logic gate having two or more inputs and a single output. An AND gate operates
            on
            logical
            multiplication rules. In this gate, if either of the inputs is low (0), then the output is also low. If all
            of
            the inputs are high (1), then the output will also be high. An AND gate can have any number of inputs,
            although
            2 input and 3 input AND gates are the most common. <br> There are two binary digits 0 and 1. We just told
            that
            an AND gate performs a binary multiplication of binary digits. In multiplying 0 with 0 we will get 0, 1 with
            0
            or 0 with 1 we will get 0. Only we get 1 when 1 is multiplied by 1.
            In other words, an AND gate is a digital device that produces high output only when all inputs are high and
            produces low output under all other inputs conditions. A high digital signal means logically 1 and a low
            digital
            signal means logically 0.</p>
